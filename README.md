# 2D-Steady-HT---Quarter-Annulus

## Overview

This project involves solving partial differential equations using various iterative methods. The code provided runs seven different methods for a given number of network divisions and calculates the discretization errors and accuracy of each method.

## Methods Implemented

### 1. Jacobi Iterative Method

### 2. Point Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method

### 3. Line Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method (r-sweep)

### 4. Line Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method (θ-sweep)

### 5. Dual Sweep Jacobi Iterative Method (r-sweep then θ-sweep)

### 6. Dual Sweep Jacobi Iterative Method (θ-sweep then r-sweep)

### 7. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) for Gauss-Seidel
